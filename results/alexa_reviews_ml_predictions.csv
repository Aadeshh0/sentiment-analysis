4,29-Jul-18,Charcoal Fabric ,"The Echo is an amazing device.  Many times it seems very intuitive.  But at other times I ask for something that seems clear and simple and get no result.  Installation was fairly straightforward, but I messed up several times simply because I thought a step was complete when it wasn't.  This actually made me lose ground until I figured that out.  My advice is to be patient; the app will let you know when you can move on to the next step.My biggest issue of the moment is that we have several Echo devices in our home and I would like to use them as intercoms (which I am told can be done).  However, I can't make any of the Echos aware of the others existence.  When I ask Alexa how to do this she answers about instructions how to change her name.  I know this is likely my fault, but I would think the designers would anticipate this and make it easier to find the needed instructions.  A small deal for many device savvy people, but a challenge for me.",1,Positive,Positive,echo amazing device many time seems intuitive time ask something seems clear simple get result installation fairly straightforward messed several time simply thought step complete wasnt actually made lose ground figured advice patient app let know move next stepmy biggest issue moment several echo device home would like use intercom told done however cant make echo aware others existence ask alexa answer instruction change name know likely fault would think designer would anticipate make easier find needed instruction small deal many device savvy people challenge,Positive

3,12-Jun-18,Black,"I received my Echo Dot today in good condition, but be advised: I paid $29.99 for it and Amazon has (as of this writing) raised the price to $39.99, so do your research before buying so you can get a good deal!Set up with the Dot went simple enough — plug it in, follow the app instructions... except initially it took a while to actually show up in my iPhone’s WiFi settings. I called Amazon customer service, and I dunno what it is, but lately I’ve been getting terrible support. The guy that took my call just rambled off a (completely unhelpful) script and I ended up setting up the Dot while he was in the middle of his spiel.I’m not sure if this is the norm or if it’s because this is refurbished, but the Dot has a pretty finicky wifi range and randomly disconnects even though the app shows that the range of my 5GHz connection is strong. Reconnecting is a pain each time as well.All that said, when Alexa works, she works amazingly well. I don’t have a speaker hooked up to it, but one thing I really enjoy is the mic’s range and sensitivity. One of the more annoying limitations of Apple’s Siri is that when she’s playing audio through device speakers (music, podcasts, etc), the “Hey Siri” feature is all but useless. Alexa has no problem hearing me over whatever is playing at the time, and with amazingly fast responsiveness too. I haven’t tried this with louder speakers yet, so I’m not sure if this will continue to hold true.Setting up Alexa to control all my wireless devices was a breeze, albeit with limitations — support for Arlo devices is nil, and if you have special settings for your LED devices (eg. rainbow effects), Alexa can’t handle them, she only knows how to change solid colors and brightness levels.All in all, my rating would’ve been lower had I not gotten a decent price on this item. If the connectivity problems persist, I may have to exchange/return this item. I don’t want to though — Alexa’s kind of growing on me.",1,Neutral,Negative,received echo dot today good condition advised paid amazon writing raised price research buying get good dealset dot went simple enough plug follow app instruction except initially took actually show iphones wifi setting called amazon customer service dunno lately ive getting terrible support guy took call rambled completely unhelpful script ended setting dot middle spielim sure norm refurbished dot pretty finicky wifi range randomly disconnect even though app show range ghz connection strong reconnecting pain time wellall said alexa work work amazingly well dont speaker hooked one thing really enjoy mics range sensitivity one annoying limitation apple siri shes playing audio device speaker music podcasts etc hey siri feature useless alexa problem hearing whatever playing time amazingly fast responsiveness havent tried louder speaker yet sure continue hold truesetting alexa control wireless device breeze albeit limitation support arlo device nil special setting led device rainbow effect alexa cant handle know change solid color brightness levelsall rating wouldve lower gotten decent price item connectivity problem persist may exchangereturn item dont want though alexas kind growing,Negative

Installation was fairly straightforward, but I messed up several times simply because I thought a step was complete when it wasn't.  This actually made me lose ground until I figured that out.  My advice is to be patient; the app will let you know when you can move on to the next step.My biggest issue of the moment is that we have several Echo devices in our home and I would like to use them as intercoms (which I am told can be done).  However, I can't make any of the Echos aware of the others existence.  When I ask Alexa how to do this she answers about instructions how to change her name.  I know this is likely my fault, but I would think the designers would anticipate this and make it easier to find the needed instructions.  A small deal for many device savvy people, but a challenge for me.",1,Positive,Positive,echo amazing device many time seems intuitive time ask something seems clear simple get result installation fairly straightforward messed several time simply thought step complete wasnt actually made lose ground figured advice patient app let know move next stepmy biggest issue moment several echo device home would like use intercom told done however cant make echo aware others existence ask alexa answer instruction change name know likely fault would think designer would anticipate make easier find needed instruction small deal many device savvy people challenge,Positive

In order to turn off a repeating alarm in the morning you pretty much have to talk - which is not a thing you usually want to do when first woken up and your bed partner will definitely not like.  YES, you can manually swipe up on the alarm face to dismiss but i) swiping up rather than touching screen when you are half asleep is very difficult and results in setting snooze more than half the time even if you really try to swipe to dismiss and ii) if you do manage to swipe up to dismiss, then you completely delete your recurring alarm.This is especially annoying as Amazon could so easily fix this by simply making touching the screen turn off the alarm but NOT delete it or at least make it a setting to decide whether touching the screen for a recurring alarm snoozes or turns it off.  But as the clock has been out for a year now and they still haven't adding this setting, clearly not going to happen.

5,21-Jul-18,Black  Spot,"I got this on Prime day and figured I'd see what all the hype is about.  Honestly I didn't really want to like it as personally bugging my house seems kinda weird, but honestly, I love it.  Like it or not this is the way the world is going, so why not.I loved it so much I ordered 2.  I didn't get the Show because it looks like it came from the 1990's and is downright ugly.  I have no interest on watching anything on these devices anyway, so the Spot's screen does not bother me - although it is very clear.Alexa can hear you from pretty much everywhere.  My favorite part about this is having it in our living room where it's hooked up to our bluetooth soundbar - where I can just say play any song I want and it will.  I guess I could just pick up my smartphone to do that, but you don't know how much easier it is to interact with media using your voice rather than navigating through multiple pages.The one thing that I am not a fan of is the home screen cards do not really rotate that much - they also do not rotate when playing music.  I'd love for it to display the weather as I listen to music.The screen is clear and I also really enjoy Alexa being able to tell me how my commute will be - there is a great skill that you can download that will tell you traffic to 5 different places (that you program and name) so you can say alexa give me traffic to my parents - and she will tell you the best route and time you will arrive in current traffic.  I have this programmed for my parents, fiances parents, work, and her work.  So it really works great.The one thing that I actually preferred the Dot over the Spot is the dot will light up different colors when you have package notifications.. I have not seen the Spot really do much for package notifications yet.  The dot it was very easy to tell when something was delivered.  I would recommend Amazon do exactly what they did for the Dot but on the Spot - the Dot lights up colors - why can't the Spot ?  The same way you command alexa and you get that blue ring, just make that ring yellow when a package is updated for delivery.Overall it's a great device that I am looking forward to integrating my home around.  I'm already looking at dash buttons, smart plugs, etc..- and = when I become a home owner instead of renting where I can't tinker with my thermostat I will be purchasing a Nest down the road for HVAC integration.",1,Positive,Positive,got prime day figured see hype honestly didnt really want like personally bugging house seems kinda weird honestly love like way world going noti loved much ordered didnt get show look like came downright ugly interest watching anything device anyway spot screen bother although clearalexa hear pretty much everywhere favorite part living room hooked bluetooth soundbar say play song want guess could pick smartphone dont know much easier interact medium using voice rather navigating multiple pagesthe one thing fan home screen card really rotate much also rotate playing music love display weather listen musicthe screen clear also really enjoy alexa able tell commute great skill download tell traffic different place program name say alexa give traffic parent tell best route time arrive current traffic programmed parent fiance parent work work really work greatthe one thing actually preferred dot spot dot light different color package notification seen spot really much package notification yet dot easy tell something delivered would recommend amazon exactly dot spot dot light color cant spot way command alexa get blue ring make ring yellow package updated deliveryoverall great device looking forward integrating home around already looking dash button smart plug etc become home owner instead renting cant tinker thermostat purchasing nest road hvac integration,Positive

3,17-Jul-18,Black  Spot,"This is 1 of 6 echo devices in the house and is currently being deployed as a bedside alarm clock.  I use it basically as an echo dot with a clock attached and may occasionally pull up camera video.  Audio quality and screen quality are really are not appropriate for music or watching video.  Much of the time it works well as alarm clock, but there are some serious flaws, particularly if you are the last one to bed or the first to wake.  It doesn’t seem like the engineers actually tested this in a bedroom with 2 people on different schedules.  Try walking into a dark bedroom with a sleeping wife and waking her up by saying “Alexa set an alarm for 5am” and then having Alexa repeat “OK alarm set for 5am.”  Not good.  I suppose you could whisper then fumble for the volume down button but that is stupid.  Plain and simple, this device needs to be brought into the 1990’s and have simple touch screen interface added to set an alarm.  I know there is a cumbersome interface for these situations where one can set an alarm from the alexa app on your phone.  No thanks, if I’m picking up my phone to set an alarm I will just use its built in alarm and save a step.  At least the engineers allow the alarm to be turned off from the touch screen, so for example if you wake up a few minutes early you can cancel the alarm without speaking and waking your spouse.  The interface for using the touch screen to cancel an alarm that has gone off is however not great.  There should be separate snooze and cancel buttons.  Currently a touch snoozes and a swipe cancels.  It is too easy when half awake to snooze when you think you have cancelled.  When the snoozed alarm goes off a few minutes later, my not amused and no longer sleeping wife will let me know by summoning Alexa to turn off the bathroom lights while I’m in the shower.",1,Neutral,Negative,echo device house currently deployed bedside alarm clock use basically echo dot clock attached may occasionally pull camera video audio quality screen quality really appropriate music watching video much time work well alarm clock serious flaw particularly last one bed first wake doesnt seem like engineer actually tested bedroom people different schedule try walking dark bedroom sleeping wife waking saying alexa set alarm alexa repeat alarm set good suppose could whisper fumble volume button stupid plain simple device need brought simple touch screen interface added set alarm know cumbersome interface situation one set alarm alexa app phone thanks picking phone set alarm use built alarm save step least engineer allow alarm turned touch screen example wake minute early cancel alarm without speaking waking spouse interface using touch screen cancel alarm gone however great separate snooze cancel button currently touch snooze swipe cancel easy half awake snooze think cancelled snoozed alarm go minute later amused longer sleeping wife let know summoning alexa turn bathroom light shower,Negative

Sometimes it takes a few tries to get Alexa to perform a command...but as I get to know the system better, I’m hoping that will improve.  One drawback in the music...I’ve noticed a lot of the songs from years past, are re-recordings by the original artist...but not the original recording itself.  Example: Secret Agent Man by Johnny Rivers...a “live”version is used, not the original version.  If I’m going to pay for Prime Music...I’d like to hear the original version of songs...not later recordings.  Or at least give me a choice of what I want to hear.

This $100 piece of crap doesnt even know how to respond to a question that amazon themselves told me to ask her. (Echo buttons manual, see Step 3.) The device has potential given it has a big screen, decent sound but for 200 bucks, I would never reccomend it. Even for the $100 I spent, I feel like I got shorted. Oh and lastly, the device is pretty useless without a prime membership. I linked my personal account to it and the thing was literally a decorated bluetooth speaker. I went on the family account (this one) and got it to work minimal. Oh, and even with our prime membership, you have to have a music pass or something that's an extra 3.99 a month, leaving this item a subscription nightmare, and a overpriced, decorated bluetooth speaker in my eyes.

4,28-Jul-18,Black  Plus,"I love everything about it. I love that the echo plus turns on and off my light. It can also dim them with voice commands. I also like listening to my kindle books even the ones that I didn’t purchased  audibles for. I like that it can play my music from Amazon music, pandora, tunein, I heart radio and Spotify. Echo can even play my local radio station. I love that the echo is connected to my TiVo Bolt. This allows TiVo to pause, stop and play whatever I want with a simple voice command. I love that I can reorder items that I purchased on Amazon and that the echo plus notifies me when my order is mailed, when it will be delivered and when the package has been delivered.

I already had an Echo Dot in my Kitchen/Den area, so I placed the Echo Plus with Hub in my bedroom. My radio and lamps in my Kitchen and Den are controlled with TP-Link plugs.  But, the ceiling light fixtures and lamp in my Den and Bedroom have special Philips Hue Light Bulbs that are controlled by the Hub inside the Echo Plus.  I am able to play music, set my alarm, get weather reports and numerous other things on both devices.  The Echo Dot requires a TP-Link plug to be plugged into it and the Echo Plus requires a special Philips Light Bulbs installed in each light fixture to work..  The only thing I dislike is the high price of the light bulbs required to make the lights work.

3,23-Jul-18,Black  Plus,"We are a long time Amazon Prime family, many years, but new to the Alexa world and thought the purchase of Alexa Plus, with hub, and included Phillips Hue light bulb would be a great start. Alexa does a lot of good things for us like Alarm in the morning, verbalize books, playing music on command, even linked to my Sirrius/xm account. Good daily stuff. Good sound, but not Bose. But, the ads say &#34;Hub included&#34; so don't need anything else to operate devices. Well, not so. I understand there will be some differences in product device  support. The fact that it came with the Hue light bulb works only for on /off/ dimming of the bulb. The bulb is capable of so much more with the Hue App but the Hue app does not recognize Alexa hub as a bridge. So, it appears you do have to get a Philips bridge to set the bulbs for scenes, time the lights when you are away, set color tones, etc. That can all be done via internet with your phone or tablet away from home. The list goes on for its capabilities but not without its own bridge.

Maybe throw a good discount my way to get the Hue bridge if I keep the Echo Plus before I invest in more light bulbs.",1,Neutral,Negative,long time amazon prime family many year new alexa world thought purchase alexa plus hub included phillips hue light bulb would great start alexa lot good thing like alarm morning verbalize book playing music command even linked sirriusxm account good daily stuff good sound bose ad say hub included dont need anything else operate device well understand difference product device support fact came hue light bulb work dimming bulb bulb capable much hue app hue app recognize alexa hub bridge appears get philip bridge set bulb scene time light away set color tone etc done via internet phone tablet away home list go capability without bridge disappointed find fact point feel misled amazon included hue bulb without explanation maybe throw good discount way get hue bridge keep echo plus invest light bulb,Negative

I spend about a total of 4 hours attempting to add this bulb to my Alexa Echo Plus.  Everything I tried, ended in a Discovery Failed message.  I tried to set this up over and over and over again.  I watched YouTube videos.  I read set up websites.  I was the poster child of insanity (doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results).The next day I went onto Amazon to get the tech support.  I was hoping something would be done to make this thing work, but also the problem not being operator error.  Well after 3 tech support staff and 1 hr. and 19 mins. of being on the phone, it still didn't work.  This product has tested my patience.  So far this experience is shifting my mindset from going to a smart home to just kicking it old school.The only reason I gave this two stars is because Amazon will be sending me a different Echo Plus and light bulb.  The problem wasn't the bulb, because before packing up the items, I purchased another bulb and still Alexa couldn't locate this device.I pray the next attempt is successful and then I will revise this rating, but what are the odds that I was shipped a defective Echo?  The support person had the same thought.  Maybe I should be exploring the Google device but I can't get over the look of that hub.

4,20-Jul-18,Black  Plus,"I got it to try side by side with the Echo originale. They are essentially the same in dimension, weight and the woofer is the same save for the smaller tweeter point up instead of down and the built in hub. As many folks already pointed out, the hub is not a direct replacement for the Philips Hue, Z wave or anything else. It provides a sub set of features available from the stand alone hub and you ended up losing functionality that you took for granted on the dedicated hub. For me, the voice recognition and music play capability is the same, the original Echo may have an edge on the volume department due to larger speakers. The new Echo plus is priced lower than the original Echo with the built in hub but I don't really need the hub with less functionality. In addition, I don't think that Amazon will have software updates for this hub as other dedicated hub would have so bugs could end up never fixed. My Philips hub gets software update probably once every couple months and it keeps up with the changes in the new bulbs FW and they fixes bugs.

5,20-Jul-18,Black  Plus,"Incredible piece of technology.I have this right center of my living room on an island kitchen counter. The mic and speaker goes in every direction and the quality of the sound is quite good. I connected the Echo via Bluetooth to my Sony soundbar on my TV but find the Echo placement and 360 sound more appealing. It's no audiophile equipment but there is good range and decent bass. The sound is more than adequate for any indoor entertaining and loud enough to bother neighbors in my building. The knob on the top works great for adjusting volume. This is my first Echo device and I would imagine having to press volume buttons (on the Echo 2) a large inconvenience and not as precise. For that alone I would recommend this over the regular Echo (2nd generation).The piece looks quality and is quite sturdy with some weight on it. The rubber material on the bottom has a good grip on the granite counter-- my cat can even rub her scent on it without tipping it over.This order came with a free Philips Hue Bulb which I installed along with an extra one I bought. I put the 2 bulbs into my living room floor lamp, turned on the light, and all I had to do was say &#34;Alexa, connect my devices&#34;. The default names for each bulb was assigned as &#34;First light&#34; and &#34;Second light&#34;, so I can have a dimmer floor lamp if I just turned on/off one of the lights by saying &#34;Alexa, turn off the second light&#34;. In the Alexa app, I created a 'Group' with &#34;First light&#34; and &#34;Second light&#34; and named the group &#34;The light&#34;, so to turn on the lamp with both bulbs shining I just say &#34;Alexa, turn on The light&#34;.I was surprised how easily the bulbs connected to the Echo Plus with its built in hub. I thought I would have to buy a hub bridge to connect to my floor lamp power plug. Apparently there is some technology built directly inside the bulb! I was surprised by that. Awesome.You will feel like Tony Stark on this device. I added quite a few &#34;Skills&#34; like 'Thunderstorm sounds' and 'Quote of the day' . Alexa always loads them up quickly. Adding songs that you hear to specific playlists on Amazon Music is also a great feature.I can go on and on and this is only my second day of ownership.I was lucky to buy this for $100 on Prime Day, but I think for $150 is it pretty expensive considering the Echo 2 is only $100. In my opinion, you will be paying a premium for the Echo Plus and you have to decide if the value is there for you:1) Taller and 360 sound unit.2) Volume knob on top that you spin (I think this is a huge benefit over buttons)3) Built in hub for Hue bulbs. After researching more, there are some cons to this setup if you plan on having more advanced light setups. For me and my floor lamp, it's just perfect.I highly recommend it and will buy an Echo dot for my bedroom now.",1,Positive,Positive,incredible piece technologyi right center living room island kitchen counter mic speaker go every direction quality sound quite good connected echo via bluetooth sony soundbar find echo placement sound appealing audiophile equipment good range decent bass sound adequate indoor entertaining loud enough bother neighbor building knob top work great adjusting volume first echo device would imagine press volume button echo large inconvenience precise alone would recommend regular echo generationthe piece look quality quite sturdy weight rubber material bottom good grip granite counter cat even rub scent without tipping overthis order came free philip hue bulb installed along extra one bought put bulb living room floor lamp turned light say alexa connect device default name bulb assigned first light second light dimmer floor lamp turned onoff one light saying alexa turn second light alexa app created group first light second light named group light turn lamp bulb shining say alexa turn lighti surprised easily bulb connected echo plus built hub thought would buy hub bridge connect floor lamp power plug apparently technology built directly inside bulb surprised awesomeyou feel like tony stark device added quite skill like thunderstorm sound quote day alexa always load quickly adding song hear specific playlist amazon music also great featurei second day ownershipi lucky buy prime day think pretty expensive considering echo opinion paying premium echo plus decide value taller sound unit volume knob top spin think huge benefit button built hub hue bulb researching con setup plan advanced light setup floor lamp perfecti highly recommend buy echo dot bedroom,Negative

I work in the network/technology industry for a living and have for over 20 years now, so lack of experience or knowledge is not the problem here. I used the app and the device even tells me it is connected and to follow the app to continue set up, the set up screen just continues to roll the 3 dots around the screen for about 5 minutes before the app locks up on my phone and I have to force the app to close, restart my phone and the Echo and try again.

5,30-Jul-18,Configuration: Fire TV Stick,"Recently cut the cord on cable television. Needed an easy to install and relatively inexpensive alternative option to fill the gap. Ordered the Amazon Fire Stick from Best Buy. Instructions were short and easy to follow. I was going to order the Amazon Ethernet Adapter because I was worried about wireless speeds in my area, but thought I'd wait and see. Glad I did. Wireless connection has proved almost flawless so far. A few brief hiccups here and there, but I'm convinced that was from the Apps themselves. Don't miss the ridiculously high cable prices and am able to watch most of what I used to watch for a much lower price, which right now is a total of $50 a month. Amazon Fire Stick is limited to 1GB of memory and 8GB of storage. Thought that would be a huge issue when it came to downloading Apps and recording shows. So far it hasn't been any issue at all. The upcoming fall tv schedule, which includes the return of NFL Football, might prove more troublesome when I need to record more often. I'll worry about that then. My only real issue is that you can't really turn it off. The screen remains on and uses up electricity, although probably small amounts. Luckily when you unplug it, all downloaded Apps and recorded shows stay in memory. Not sure what happens when you have something scheduled to record when it's unplugged. Haven't tried it yet, although I don't think it'll be an issue with DirectTV Now, which I'm using right now. So far I'm loving the Amazon Fire Stick. Actually love that Amazon, which I use occasionally, come pre-installed.",1,Positive,Positive,recently cut cord cable television needed easy install relatively inexpensive alternative option fill gap ordered amazon fire stick best buy instruction short easy follow going order amazon ethernet adapter worried wireless speed area thought wait see glad wireless connection proved almost flawless far brief hiccup convinced apps dont miss ridiculously high cable price able watch used watch much lower price right total month amazon fire stick limited memory storage thought would huge issue came downloading apps recording show far hasnt issue upcoming fall schedule includes return nfl football might prove troublesome need record often ill worry real issue cant really turn screen remains us electricity although probably small amount luckily unplug downloaded apps recorded show stay memory sure happens something scheduled record unplugged havent tried yet although dont think itll issue directtv using right far loving amazon fire stick actually love amazon use occasionally come preinstalled,Positive

2,30-Jul-18,Black  Dot,"For the price, the product is nice quality and has a few nice features. So definitely no complaints there. The reason why I only gave it 3 stars is because the echo dot is not what I thought it was going to be so that may just be buyer error. First, I didn’t know that the product has to be plugged in at all times to work. So I really don’t like that it’s not a stand alone device. Also, the speaker is not very loud so if you are buying it as a Bluetooth speaker, don’t. Lastly, I’m sure the echo dot can do a lot but I haven’t quite figured out how to use it fully but it just kind of seems like an unnecessary device to own, plus setting it up was awful. I would definitely save the money and buy the nicer one that is actually “Alexa”.",0,Negative,Negative,price product nice quality nice feature definitely complaint reason gave star echo dot thought going may buyer error first didnt know product plugged time work really dont like stand alone device also speaker loud buying bluetooth speaker dont lastly sure echo dot lot havent quite figured use fully kind seems like unnecessary device plus setting awful would definitely save money buy nicer one actually alexa,Negative

I would have been willing to pay 10 to 20 dollars more if it had a better speaker. Oh well it is what it is and I still love it.

Lastly, I’m sure the echo dot can do a lot but I haven’t quite figured out how to use it fully but it just kind of seems like an unnecessary device to own, plus setting it up was awful. I would definitely save the money and buy the nicer one that is actually “Alexa”.",0,Negative,Negative,price product nice quality nice feature definitely complaint reason gave star echo dot thought going may buyer error first didnt know product plugged time work really dont like stand alone device also speaker loud buying bluetooth speaker dont lastly sure echo dot lot havent quite figured use fully kind seems like unnecessary device plus setting awful would definitely save money buy nicer one actually alexa,Negative
